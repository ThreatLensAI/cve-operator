                      type "Complete" and status true.


                      A job is considered finished when it is in a terminal condition, either
                      "Complete" or "Failed". A Job cannot have both the "Complete" and "Failed" conditions.

                      The job controller creates pods with a finalizer. When a pod terminates
                      (succeeded or failed), the controller does three steps to account for it
                      in the job status:


                      1. Add the pod UID to the arrays in this field.
                      2. Remove the pod finalizer.
                      3. Remove the pod UID from the arrays while increasing the corresponding
                          counter.
